So as I'm sitting here trying to set up my first blog I can't help but to realize there may be some truth to this whole theory about how advances in technology are affecting the way people read. It took me literally four hours to set this up when it should have only taken one. Why? Because I was reading the instructions on my laptop while trying to set the blog up on the same laptop. So, I had to keep toggling back and forth between pages and tabs minimizing and maximizing screens. There were also too many distractions on my laptop such as all the open tabs and constant notifications from running apps. I can't help but think this would have been easier had I just printed out the instructions.

In a Scientific American article by Ferris Jabr, the effects of reading on paper vs screens was discussed. The article mentioned there were certain aspects of reading in print that people like such as having a sense of physical location. For example, recollecting when a certain scene in a physical book took place is easier because you have a spatial sense from the pages in the book. On an internet page, the only sense of location is essentially from the scroll bar which isn't always visible. I'm almost certain the main reason it took me so long to setup the blog was because I had to go searching through all the different pages to find the particular instruction I was looking for. I couldn't remember which page or where on the page I had originally read it on, and when you have over 20 tabs open, that is not a fun task.

The article also mentioned how reading comprehension seems to be better when people read on paper. Of course, there were studies to debunk this claim but my experience seems to support it. Sometimes, most notably today when I was reading the blog setup instructions, I have to go back and re-read the same page to understand it fully. Sure I've done that while also reading printed books but not nearly as much. FOUR HOURS. It took four hours! It was like my brain just didn't want to understand what the page was trying to tell me to do. So maybe there's some truth to having a lower reading comprehension when reading on screens.

But then again maybe there isn't. In an article by Paul La Farge, he says "When the reading brain becomes able to process written symbols automatically, the thinking brain, the I, has time to go beyond those symbols, to develop itself and the culture in which it lives." Â Maybe I couldn't comprehend what I was reading because I simply wasn't allowing my thinking brain time to process the words I was seeing. I was doing too many things at once. Maybe I don't know how to multitask after all. The problem may not be the medium itself but the reader who interacts with it. If I can't focus on a screen what's to say I can focus on the page of a book. Maybe I just need to slow down and take my time reading on any medium. Maybe if I had read through the instructions first and then proceeded to set up the blog instead of doing both at the same time, it would have gotten done faster. Maybe the problem isn't reading on a screen. Maybe, just maybe, the problem is me.
